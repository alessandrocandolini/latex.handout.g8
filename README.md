# latex.handout.g8

Opinionated giter8 template for personal short LaTeX notes with github actions pipeline. 

[Giter8](https://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) is a template engine written in the [Scala programming language](https://www.scala-lang.org/), integrated in the Scala build tool ([sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)) and powered by [StringTemplate](https://www.stringtemplate.org/). 
There are plenty of templating tools available (eg, cookiecutter or jinjia in python, etc) but I find g8 particularly handy. You don't need familiarity with Scala to use or even contribute to the template. 

## How to use it 

You need either [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) or [g8](https://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) installed in your system. For example, using nix 
```bash
nix-shell -p sbt 
```
On MACOS another option can be to install it via homebrew
```
brew install sbt
```

Once sbt is installed, it is possible to generate a new project using 
```
sbt new git@github.com:alessandrocandolini/latex.handout.g8.git --name=<name> --title=<title> --author=<project author> --force
```
This will generate a folder `name` (if not already present) and create a new project in it. 

`name` is the only mandatory option here. If you don't specify the other options, by default `title=name` and `author` is set to be my personal name. 

See http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/usage.html#Usage for more details on how to use g8

## Contribute to the template

Giter8 crash course: 

* Giter8 generates a project that has exactly the same structure of the [src/main/g8](src/main/g8) folder
* template variables are defined in the [default.properties](src/main/g8/default.properties) file
* template variables can be accessed as `$name of the variable$` (ie, between `$`) from everywhere
* `$` is the reserved symbol, whenever you need to use a `$` for purposes other than referring to a template variable be sure to escape it as `\$`; this is a typical source of errors

To test the template, giter8 provides a sbt command `g8Test`, which unfortunately has some drawbacks. For this reason, the recommended approach is to test the template by generating a fake project and try to compile with LaTeX the generated code. That's exactly what the github action CI is doing.
